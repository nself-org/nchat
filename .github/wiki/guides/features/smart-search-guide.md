## Introduction

### What is Semantic Search?

Smart Search in nself-chat uses **semantic search** powered by AI embeddings to understand the meaning and context of your queries, not just match keywords. Unlike traditional search that looks for exact word matches, semantic search understands:

- **Intent**: What you're trying to find, even if you don't use the exact words
- **Context**: Related concepts and synonyms
- **Relationships**: Connections between messages, users, and channels
- **Sentiment**: Emotional tone and urgency

### Benefits of Semantic Search

**Traditional Keyword Search:**

```
Query: "server down"
Finds: Only messages containing exact words "server" AND "down"
Misses: "backend not responding", "API outage", "service unavailable"
```

**Semantic Search:**

```
Query: "server down"
Finds: All related messages:
  ✓ "server down"
  ✓ "backend not responding"
  ✓ "API returning 503 errors"
  ✓ "database connection timeout"
  ✓ "can't access production"
```

### Key Features

- **Natural Language**: Ask questions like you would to a colleague
- **Context-Aware**: Understands technical jargon, acronyms, and domain language
- **Multi-Modal**: Search text, code, files, and metadata
- **Real-Time**: Results update as new messages arrive
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Most relevant results appear first
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic understanding with keyword precision

### How It Works

Every message is converted into a **vector embedding** - a numerical representation of its meaning:

```
Message: "Our Q4 revenue exceeded expectations"
Embedding: [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12] (1536 dimensions)
```

Similar messages have similar embeddings:

```
"Q4 sales were higher than predicted" ← Very similar embedding
"It's sunny today" ← Very different embedding
```

When you search:

1. **Your query is embedded** - Converted to the same vector format
2. **Similarity calculation** - Compare your query vector to all message vectors
3. **Ranking** - Results sorted by cosine similarity (how close the vectors are)
4. **Filtering** - Apply additional filters (date, channel, user, etc.)
5. **Return results** - Show most relevant matches

## Search Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Effective Queries

#### Be Specific

```
❌ Bad:  "error"
✓ Good: "authentication error in user login flow"

❌ Bad:  "meeting"
✓ Good: "standup meeting notes from engineering team"

❌ Bad:  "docs"
✓ Good: "API documentation for payment endpoints"
```

#### Use Natural Language

```
✓ "What was decided in the pricing discussion?"
✓ "How do we handle failed payments?"
✓ "Where is the deployment runbook?"
✓ "Who has access to production database?"
```

#### Add Context

```
Instead of:           Try:
"bug"          →     "login bug affecting mobile users"
"slow"         →     "slow API response times on checkout"
"update"       →     "status update from design team on homepage"
```

### Power User Features

#### Search Shortcuts

| Shortcut      | Action              | Example                   |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `from:user`   | Messages from user  | `from:alice deployment`   |
| `in:channel`  | Messages in channel | `in:engineering docker`   |
| `has:link`    | Messages with links | `has:link documentation`  |
| `has:file`    | Messages with files | `has:file budget`         |
| `before:date` | Before date         | `before:2026-01-15 bug`   |
| `after:date`  | After date          | `after:yesterday meeting` |
| `is:starred`  | Starred messages    | `is:starred TODO`         |
| `is:unread`   | Unread messages     | `is:unread @me`           |

#### Combining Shortcuts

```
Examples:
• from:alice in:engineering has:code after:yesterday
• is:starred has:link in:documentation
• from:@engineering-team before:2026-01-01 "technical debt"
```

#### Advanced Operators

**Proximity Search**: Find words near each other

```
"database" NEAR[5] "connection"
→ Finds "database" within 5 words of "connection"
```

**Field Search**: Search specific fields

```
title:"Sprint Planning"      → Search message titles
author:alice                 → Messages by Alice
thread_count:>10            → Threads with 10+ replies
```

**Fuzzy Search**: Allow typos and variations

```
deployment~2                → Allows 2-character difference
"databse"                   → Auto-corrects to "database"
```

### Search Strategies

#### The Funnel Approach

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with general query
2. **Review Results**: See what you're getting
3. **Add Filters**: Narrow by date, user, channel
4. **Refine Query**: Adjust based on results
5. **Save Search**: If you'll need it again

```
Example: Finding deployment issues
1. Query: "deployment"              → 500 results
2. Filter: Last 7 days             → 120 results
3. Filter: Channel #production     → 45 results
4. Refine: "deployment failed"     → 12 results ✓
```

#### The Targeted Approach

1. **Know What You Want**: Specific information
2. **Use All Context**: Date, user, channel, keywords
3. **Apply Filters First**: Set constraints upfront
4. **Precise Query**: Exact terms

```
Example: Alice's message about API docs
Query: from:alice in:engineering "API documentation"
Filters: Last 30 days, has:link
→ 3 results ✓
```

#### The Exploratory Approach

1. **Ask Questions**: Natural language
2. **Browse Results**: See related content
3. **Follow Threads**: Click to see full context
4. **Discover Patterns**: Notice common themes

```
Example: Understanding a decision
Query: "Why did we choose PostgreSQL over MongoDB?"
→ Browse discussion threads
→ Find decision rationale
→ Discover related technical docs
```

### Common Search Patterns

#### Finding Decisions

```
Query: "(decided OR approved OR agreed) database choice"
Filters: From team leads, Last quarter
```

#### Tracking Action Items

```
Query: "TODO OR action item OR follow-up"
Filters: Mentions @me, Is unread
```

#### Debugging Issues

```
Query: error type AND environment AND symptoms
Filters: Channel #production, Last 24 hours
Example: "500 error API production timeout"
```

#### Research & Learning

```
Query: "how to" OR "guide" OR "tutorial" OR "documentation"
Filters: Has links or files, Specific channels
```

#### Meeting Follow-ups

```
Query: "meeting notes" OR "minutes" OR "summary"
Filters: From specific user, This week, Has TODO
```

### Optimization Tips

#### Search Performance

**Fast Searches**:

- Use date filters (reduces search space)
- Search specific channels (not all)
- Use exact phrases for known terms
- Limit results with filters

**Slow Searches**:

- Avoid: `*` wildcards at start of words
- Avoid: Very common words alone ("the", "and")
- Avoid: Searching "All time" unnecessarily

#### Result Quality

**Improve Relevance**:

- Add more context words
- Use specific technical terms
- Include user or channel filters
- Try different phrasings

**Too Many Results**:

- Add date range
- Specify channel or user
- Use more specific terms
- Use phrase search with quotes

**Too Few Results**:

- Remove restrictive filters
- Try synonyms or related terms
- Expand date range
- Use broader search terms

## Voice Search

### Enabling Voice Search

#### Requirements

- Microphone access (browser permission required)
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- HTTPS connection (required for Web Speech API)

#### Setup

1. Go to Settings → Search → Voice Search
2. Enable "Voice Search"
3. Grant microphone permission when prompted
4. Test your microphone

```
Voice Search Settings:
☑ Enable voice search
Language: [English (US) ▼]
Activation: ○ Click to speak
           ○ Always listening (with wake word)
Wake word: [Hey nchat]
Auto-punctuation: ☑ Enabled
Confidence threshold: [70% ▼]
```

### Using Voice Search

#### Click to Speak

1. Click the microphone icon (🎤) in search bar
2. Speak your query clearly
3. Wait for transcription
4. Review and refine if needed

```
🎤 Listening...
─────────────
"What did Alice say about the deployment yesterday?"

Understood: what did alice say about the deployment yesterday

[Search] [Edit] [Cancel]
```

#### Wake Word Mode (Optional)

1. Enable "Always listening" mode
2. Say wake word: "Hey nchat"
3. Speak your query
4. System automatically searches

```
Example session:
You: "Hey nchat"
System: *beep* (listening)
You: "Find messages about the API bug"
System: *searching* (displays results)
```

#### Voice Commands

**Search Commands**:

```
"Search for [query]"
"Find messages about [topic]"
"Show me [query]"
"Look up [information]"
"What did [user] say about [topic]?"
```

**Navigation**:

```
"Next result"
"Previous result"
"Open first result"
"Go back"
"Show more"
```

**Filters**:

```
"From Alice"
"In engineering channel"
"Last week"
"Show files only"
"Messages with links"
```

**Actions**:

```
"Save this search"
"Clear filters"
"Export results"
"Close search"
```

### Voice Search Tips

#### Speaking Clearly

- Speak at normal pace (not too fast)
- Enunciate technical terms
- Pause between commands and queries
- Speak in a quiet environment
- Use punctuation words when needed

#### Handling Technical Terms

```
Spell mode for unusual terms:
"Search for K-U-B-E-R-N-E-T-E-S"
"Find messages about G-R-P-C"

Or use natural pronunciation:
"Kubernetes" → usually understood
"gRPC" → say "gee-R-P-C"
"PostgreSQL" → say "post-gres-Q-L"
```

#### Multi-Step Queries

```
Say: "Search for deployment issues"
→ See results
Say: "From last week"
→ Filter applied
Say: "In production channel"
→ Further refined
Say: "Show the first result"
→ Opens message
```

#### Using Punctuation

```
"Find messages with question mark in them"
"Search for error comma timeout comma or failure"
"Messages from Alice period Show files only period"
```

### Voice Search Accuracy

#### Improving Recognition

- **Train your voice**: Use voice search regularly
- **Check transcription**: Always review before searching
- **Use punctuation words**: Say "comma", "period", "question mark"
- **Spell difficult words**: Use spelling mode
- **Adjust settings**: Tweak confidence threshold

#### Common Issues and Solutions

```
Issue: Background noise affecting recognition
Solution:
• Use push-to-talk mode
• Find a quieter location
• Use headset with noise cancellation

Issue: Accent/dialect not recognized well
Solution:
• Adjust language settings
• Speak more slowly
• Use text fallback for complex queries

Issue: Technical terms misheard
Solution:
• Spell out the term
• Use common synonyms first
• Type difficult terms manually
```

#### Transcription Examples

```
What you say:        What it hears:
─────────────────────────────────────────────
"Kubernetes issue"   ✓ kubernetes issue
"Cooper Nettie's"    ✗ Fix: Spell K-U-B-E-R-N-E-T-E-S

"API timeout"        ✓ API timeout
"A P I timeout"      ✓ API timeout

"PostgreSQL error"   ✓ PostgreSQL error
"Post grass error"   ✗ Fix: Say "post-gres-Q-L"
```

### Accessibility Features

Voice search supports accessibility:

- **Screen readers**: Full compatibility with ARIA labels
- **Hands-free operation**: Voice-only navigation
- **Visual feedback**: See transcription in real-time
- **Error correction**: Easy editing of transcripts
- **Keyboard alternatives**: All voice commands have keyboard shortcuts

#### Screen Reader Integration

```
Voice search announces:
• "Voice search activated"
• "Listening for your query"
• "Transcription: [your query]"
• "Found 23 results for [query]"
• "Search completed"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Search Not Working

**Symptom**: Search bar doesn't respond or shows error

**Solutions**:

1. **Refresh the page**: `Cmd+R` or `Ctrl+R`
2. **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Privacy → Clear cache
3. **Check browser console**: `F12` → Look for errors
4. **Try incognito/private mode**: Rule out extensions
5. **Update browser**: Ensure latest version
6. **Check internet connection**: Must be online for search

```bash
# Developer console troubleshooting
# Press F12 and check for errors

Common errors:
• "Network error" → Check internet connection
• "Unauthorized" → Re-login required
• "Service unavailable" → Backend issue (contact admin)
• "Index not ready" → Wait for indexing to complete
```

#### No Results Found

**Symptom**: "No results" for query you know should match

**Troubleshooting Checklist**:

```
✓ Check spelling and typos
✓ Verify date range (expand to "All time")
✓ Remove restrictive filters
✓ Check channel access (can you see the channel?)
✓ Try synonyms or related terms
✓ Use simpler query (remove complex operators)
✓ Check if message was deleted
✓ Verify you're searching correct workspace
```

**Example**:

```
❌ Query: "kubernetees deployment in production channel yesterday"
   Filters: Channel=#staging, Last 7 days
   Issue: Typo + wrong channel + may be older

✓ Query: "kubernetes deployment"
   Filters: All channels, All time
   → 45 results found
   → Then refine based on results
```

**Admin Troubleshooting**:

```
If messages should exist but don't appear:
1. Check index coverage: Admin → AI → Embeddings
2. Verify message is indexed:
   SELECT * FROM embeddings WHERE message_id = 'msg_123'
3. Trigger re-index for specific channel
4. Check embedding errors log
```

#### Slow Search Performance

**Symptom**: Search takes >5 seconds to return results

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Large result set**

   ```
   Problem: Too many matching results
   Solution:
   • Add date filter (last 7 days, not all time)
   • Specify channel
   • Use more specific terms
   ```

2. **Complex query**

   ```
   Problem: Too many operators or wildcards
   Solution:
   • Simplify operators
   • Avoid too many wildcards (especially at start: *term)
   • Remove unnecessary filters
   • Use simpler natural language
   ```

3. **Network issues**

   ```
   Problem: Slow internet or high latency
   Solution:
   • Check internet connection speed
   • Try wired connection instead of WiFi
   • Disable VPN temporarily
   • Check network DevTools: F12 → Network tab
   ```

4. **Server load**
   ```
   Problem: High server usage
   Solution:
   • Wait and retry in a few minutes
   • Check status page (if available)
   • Contact admin if persistent
   ```

**Performance Benchmarks**:

```
Expected response times:
Simple query:      < 200ms
Filtered query:    < 300ms
Complex query:     < 500ms
Voice query:       < 600ms (includes transcription)

If exceeding these consistently:
→ Contact admin for performance optimization
```

#### Search Results Out of Date

**Symptom**: New messages don't appear in search immediately

**Expected Behavior**:

```
Normal indexing delay:
• New messages: 2-5 minutes
• Edited messages: 1-2 minutes
• Deleted messages: 5-10 minutes (removal)

If delay > 15 minutes:
1. Force refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. Check index status (admin)
3. Look for indexing errors
```

**Solutions**:

```
1. Wait for indexing (usually <5 minutes)
2. Force refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
3. Clear local cache: Settings → Advanced → Clear cache
4. Check index status (admin):
   Admin → Search → Index Status
   Last updated: [timestamp]
5. Trigger re-index if admin:
   Admin → Search → Re-index → Current channel
```

**Admin Troubleshooting**:

```
Index Status Dashboard:
• Last update: 2 minutes ago ✓
• Pending: 47 messages
• Failed: 3 messages ⚠️

If indexing stopped:
1. Check embedding service status
2. Review error logs
3. Restart indexing worker
4. Trigger manual re-index
```

#### Voice Search Not Working

**Symptom**: Microphone not recognized or voice not transcribed

**Checklist**:

```
✓ Grant microphone permission (browser prompt)
✓ Check site uses HTTPS (required for mic access)
✓ Test mic in browser settings
✓ Close other apps using microphone (Zoom, etc.)
✓ Try different browser
✓ Check system microphone permissions
✓ Verify microphone is default input device
```

**Browser Permissions**:

```
Chrome:
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Site settings → Microphone → Allow
Or: Settings → Privacy → Site Settings → Microphone

Firefox:
1. Click lock icon → More information
2. Permissions → Microphone → Allow
Or: Settings → Privacy → Permissions → Microphone

Safari:
1. Safari → Preferences → Websites

```

**Testing Microphone**:

```
Test your microphone:
1. Settings → Voice Search → Test Microphone
2. Speak into mic
3. See audio level visualization
4. Hear transcription in real-time

If no audio detected:
• Check mic is not muted
• Verify correct input device selected
• Test with system sound recorder
```

### Error Messages

#### "Search service unavailable"

**Meaning**: Backend search service is down or unreachable

**What you see**:

```
⚠️  Search service unavailable
We're having trouble connecting to the search service.
Please try again in a moment.

[Retry] [Use Basic Search]
```

**Solutions**:

1. Wait 1-2 minutes and click "Retry"
2. Check status page (if available): status.yourcompany.com
3. Use "Basic Search" as fallback (keyword only)
4. Contact admin if issue persists >5 minutes
5. Check internet connection

**Admin Actions**:

```
1. Check search service status:
   docker ps | grep search-service

2. View service logs:
   docker logs search-service --tail 100

3. Restart service if needed:
   docker restart search-service

4. Check Grafana dashboard for alerts
```

#### "Index is being rebuilt"

**Meaning**: Search index is updating, limited functionality temporarily

**What you see**:

```
ℹ️  Index is being rebuilt
Search index is being updated. Some results may be incomplete.
Estimated completion: 15 minutes

Progress: ████████░░ 78%

[Use Basic Search] [Dismiss]
```

**What to do**:

- Wait for completion (progress shown)
- Basic keyword search still available
- Full semantic search restored after rebuild
- Typical time: 15-30 minutes for full workspace

**When this happens**:

- Scheduled weekly maintenance (Sunday 2 AM)
- Admin triggered manual re-index
- After major system update
- When adding new search features

#### "Too many requests"

**Meaning**: Rate limit exceeded, too many searches in short time

**What you see**:

```
⚠️  Too many requests
You've made too many search requests. Please wait a moment.

Try again in: 45 seconds

[Wait] [Contact Support]
```

**Rate Limits** (default):

```
Per user:
• 60 searches per minute
• 1,000 searches per hour
• 10,000 searches per day

If exceeded:
• Wait 60 seconds
• Use saved searches (not rate limited)
• Contact admin to increase limit
```

**Solutions**:

- Wait 60 seconds before next search
- Reduce search frequency
- Use saved searches instead of repeating queries
- Contact admin to increase your rate limit
- Check if you have runaway automation

#### "Query too complex"

**Meaning**: Query has too many operators, filters, or nested conditions

**What you see**:

```
⚠️  Query too complex
Your search query is too complex. Please simplify it.

Issues detected:
• Too many boolean operators (max 10)
• Too many filters (max 8)

[Simplify] [Learn More]
```

**Solutions**:

```
Simplify complex query:

❌ Too complex:
(error OR failure OR timeout OR crash OR bug) AND
(api OR backend OR server OR service) AND
(production OR staging OR prod OR live) NOT
(test OR testing OR dev OR development)
from:alice OR from:bob OR from:charlie
in:engineering OR in:devops OR in:platform
after:2026-01-01 before:2026-01-31
has:attachment has:code has:link

✓ Simplified:
"production api error"
Filters: From @engineering-team, Last month, Has code

Then add filters instead of query operators
```

**Limits**:

```
Query constraints:
• Max boolean operators: 10
• Max filters: 8
• Max query length: 500 characters
• Max wildcard terms: 5
• Max nested groups: 3
```

#### "Insufficient permissions"

**Meaning**: You don't have access to search certain channels or content

**What you see**:

```
⚠️  Insufficient permissions
Some results were excluded because you don't have access.

Showing 12 of 45 potential results.

[Request Access] [Contact Admin]
```

**Why this happens**:

- Private channels you're not a member of
- Admin-only content
- Deleted channels
- Restricted file types

**Solutions**:

- Request access to specific channels
- Contact admin for permission
- Filter to only channels you have access to

### Performance Optimization

#### Faster Searches

**Best Practices**:

```
Do:
✓ Use date filters (last 7 days, not all time)
✓ Search specific channels (not all channels)
✓ Use exact phrases ("out of memory")
✓ Leverage saved searches
✓ Start specific, then broaden if needed

Don't:
✗ Use wildcards at word start (*error)
✗ Search all channels + all time unnecessarily
✗ Use very common words alone ("the", "a", "is")
✗ Over-use complex boolean operators
✗ Include too many filters at once
```

**Query Optimization**:

```
Slow (450ms):
*deployment in:* after:2020-01-01

Fast (180ms):
deployment in:engineering after:last-week
```

#### Better Results

**Improve Relevance**:

```
1. Add context: "login error mobile app" > "error"
2. Use technical terms: "PostgreSQL deadlock" > "database stuck"
3. Include user/channel: from:alice in:engineering
4. Try different phrasings:
   • "deploy failed" vs "deployment error"
   • "slow performance" vs "high latency"
```

**Handle Too Many Results** (>100):

```
Narrow down:
1. Add date range: after:last-week
2. Specify channel: in:engineering
3. Add user filter: from:alice
4. Use more specific terms: "authentication error" > "error"
5. Use phrase search: "out of memory"
```

**Handle Too Few Results** (<3):

```
Broaden search:
1. Remove restrictive filters
2. Try synonyms:
   • "bug" → "issue", "problem", "error"
   • "docs" → "documentation", "guide", "reference"
3. Expand date range: all time
4. Use broader terms: "auth" > "authentication"
5. Check spelling
```

### Admin Troubleshooting

#### Re-index Content

**When to re-index**:

- Messages not appearing in search
- Search results seem outdated
- After system upgrades
- Weekly maintenance

```
Admin → Search → Index Management

Actions:
• Re-index all messages: Full rebuild (2-4 hours)
• Re-index since date: Partial rebuild (faster)
• Re-index channel: Single channel only (15 min)
• Re-index user: All messages from user
• Verify index: Check for issues (read-only)

[Re-index All] [Schedule Re-index] [Verify Index]
```

**Re-indexing Options**:

```
Full Re-index:
Estimated time: 2-4 hours
Messages: 1.2M
Impact: Search available during re-index

Incremental Re-index:
Since: [Last 7 days ▼]
Messages: ~50,000
Estimated time: 30 minutes

[Start Re-index]
```
