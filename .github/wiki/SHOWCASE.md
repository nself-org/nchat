# ɳChat Feature Showcase

**Version**: 0.9.2
**Purpose**: Demonstrate the complete capabilities of ɳSelf CLI through a production-grade reference implementation
**Live Demos**: See this in action at:
- 🏠 **Local**: [chat.local.nself.org](https://chat.local.nself.org) (or localhost:3000)
- 🧪 **Staging**: [chat.staging.nself.org](https://chat.staging.nself.org)
- 🌐 **Production**: [chat.nself.org](https://chat.nself.org)

---

## 🎯 What This Showcases

### 1. **Complete Backend Infrastructure (ɳSelf CLI)**

**One Command, Everything Running:**
```bash
cd backend
nself start
```

**What Starts Automatically:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL with 222 tables
- ✅ Hasura GraphQL API
- ✅ Nhost Authentication
- ✅ MinIO S3 Storage
- ✅ Redis Cache
- ✅ MeiliSearch
- ✅ MailPit (dev email)
- ✅ Nginx with SSL
- ✅ Admin Dashboard
- ✅ WebSocket Server
- ✅ Storage Service

**Zero Configuration:**
- 🔒 Automatic SSL certificates (no browser warnings!)
- 🌐 Works with `*.local.nself.org` domains (resolves to 127.0.0.1)
- 📊 All services pre-configured and talking to each other
- 🔐 JWT auth configured
- 📝 GraphQL schema generated
- 🗄️ Database migrations ready

### 2. **Real-Time Features (GraphQL Subscriptions)**

**Live Demo Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Typing Indicators**
1. Login as `user@nself.org` in Browser 1
2. Login as `helper@nself.org` in Browser 2
3. Start typing in Browser 1 → See "User is typing..." in Browser 2
4. Stop typing → Indicator disappears

**Scenario B: Instant Message Delivery**
1. Open same channel in 2 browsers (different users)
2. Send message in Browser 1 → Appears instantly in Browser 2
3. No refresh needed, no polling, true push

**Scenario C: Presence Tracking**
1. User comes online → Green dot appears
2. User goes offline → Gray dot
3. User idle for 5 minutes → Yellow dot

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses Hasura GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket
- Real-time database changes streamed to clients
- Efficient: Only sends changed data
- Scalable: Hasura handles connection management

### 3. **Authentication Showcase**

**11 OAuth Providers Configured:**
- 🔵 Google
- 🐙 GitHub
- 🪟 Microsoft
- 🍎 Apple
- 📘 Facebook
- 🐦 Twitter/X
- 💼 LinkedIn
- 🎮 Discord
- 🔒 ID.me (military verification)
- 📱 Twitch
- 🎨 Figma

**Email/Password:**
- ✅ Secure bcrypt hashing
- ✅ Email verification
- ✅ Password reset flows
- ✅ Rate limiting

**Magic Links:**
- ✅ Passwordless login
- ✅ Time-limited tokens
- ✅ One-click authentication

**Two-Factor Authentication:**
- ✅ TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- ✅ Backup codes
- ✅ Recovery options

**Demo Accounts (Local/Staging Only):**

Role hierarchy with **descending access levels** (1 = highest, 6 = no special role):

| # | Email | Password | Role | Showcase |
|---|-------|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | owner@nself.org | `password` | **Owner** | Top level - Cannot be removed, all access |
| 2 | admin@nself.org | `password` | **Admin** | High-level administration |
| 3 | mod@nself.org | `password` | **Moderator** | Content moderation |
| 4 | support@nself.org | `password` | **Support** | User support with limited admin |
| 5 | helper@nself.org | `password` | **Helper** | Community helper with limited mod |
| 6 | user@nself.org | `password` | *(no role)* | Regular user - No special permissions |

### 4. **Per-App RBAC (Monorepo Ready)**

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Same user can have different roles in different apps
- ✅ Login once, access multiple apps (SSO)
- ✅ Granular permissions per application

**Example Monorepo Setup:**
```
monorepo/
├── backend/           # One shared ɳSelf backend
├── nchat/            # This app
├── ntv/              # Media streaming app
└── nfamily/          # Family organizer app
```

**User Experience:**
1. User logs in to ɳChat → Admin role
2. User visits ɳTV → Member role (different!)
3. User visits ɳFamily → Owner role (different again!)
4. **No separate logins** - SSO across all apps

**Showcase Scenario:**
```bash
# Login as admin@nself.org
curl -X POST https://auth.local.nself.org/v1/signin/email-password \
  -d '{"email":"admin@nself.org","password":"password"}'

# Check role in nchat
query {
  app_user_roles(where: {user_id: {_eq: "..."}}) {
    app_id
    role
  }
}

# Returns: [
#   { app_id: "nchat", role: "admin" },
#   { app_id: "ntv", role: "member" }
# ]
```

Frontend: localhost:3000 (pnpm dev)
Database: PostgreSQL local
Storage: MinIO local
Email: MailPit (all emails captured locally)
```

**Staging (VPS):**
```bash
Domain: chat.staging.nself.org
Backend: Same nself setup, ENV=staging
Frontend: Next.js on VPS
Database: PostgreSQL on VPS
Storage: MinIO or S3
Email: Real SMTP (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
Protection: HTTP basic auth (team password)
```

**Production (Vercel):**
```bash
Domain: chat.nself.org
Backend: nself on dedicated server
Frontend: Vercel edge network
Database: PostgreSQL production
Storage: AWS S3 or CloudFlare R2
Email: Production SMTP
SSL: Let's Encrypt via nself
CDN: Vercel + CloudFlare
```

**What Makes This Easy:**

## 🎤 Demo Scripts

### For Technical Audience

"Let me show you how fast you can get a production-grade chat app running with ɳSelf CLI."

*Clone and start backend*

"Notice: One command just started PostgreSQL, Hasura GraphQL, authentication, storage, search, and 6 other services. All pre-configured. Automatic SSL certificates. No YAML files to edit."

*Start frontend*

"Frontend connects to backend via GraphQL. Real-time subscriptions already working."

*Show real-time features*

"See the typing indicators? GraphQL subscriptions. Not polling. True push. Same technology Slack and Discord use."

*Show authentication*

"Six demo users with different permission levels. Owner, admin, moderator, regular member. Try to delete a message as a regular user? Denied. As a moderator? Works. That's row-level security enforced at the database level."

*Show deployment options*

"Same codebase deploys to web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux. From local development to staging to production with environment-specific configs. One backend serves all platforms."

### For Business Audience

"This is a complete Slack/Discord competitor that you can white-label and deploy yourself in under 10 minutes."

*Show features*

"Everything you expect: Direct messages, channels, file sharing, search, voice/video calls. Plus end-to-end encryption, which even Slack doesn't have."

*Show customization*

"Want it to look like your brand? Change the logo, colors, domain. Setup wizard walks you through it. Ten minutes total."

*Show deployment options*

"Deploy on your infrastructure - your VPS, your AWS account, or even your laptop. Or use Vercel for the frontend. Your data stays where you want it."

*Show cost comparison*

"Slack charges $7-12 per user per month. This? The software is free. You only pay for hosting - maybe $50-100/month total for unlimited users."
